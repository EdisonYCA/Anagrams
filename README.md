# SelectionSortAnagrams
This basic program prompts a user for two strings, and determines wether the words are anagrams (that is, they share exactly the same letters).
The program does this by converting the strings into char arrays and using a selection sort to sort the arrays before comparing the strings. 
Visit the "SelectionSortAnagrams.java" for the program source code.
